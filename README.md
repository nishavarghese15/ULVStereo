## Summary of ULVStereo

1. ULVStereo contains pairs of videos of 10 different submerged UW 3D structures found at a depth of 4-7 m from the sea surface, captured by a stereo-camera setup.
1. In each set, UW image pairs contain a lowlight image and the corresponding bright-light image counterpart.
1. ULVStereo is captured using two GoPro Hero 10 Black cameras with 30 fps and 1920 Ã— 1080 resolution placed on a stereo rig setup with a known baseline. Camera intrinsics as well as extrinsic parameters are provided.
1. ULVStereo should enable researchers in the underwater domain to harness it for many applications like underwater low-light image enhancement, depth estimation, 3D underwater structure recovery, lowlight underwater neural radiance fields, and Gaussian splatting, etc.
